This is a simple database project containing and displaying information about which countries fought in which
battles in World War 1.

All of the battle information (outcome, participants, number of casualties, number of soldiers) came from
Wikipedia.com. More specifically: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_War_I_battles and links therein. 

The front end is in PHP so this is essentially a webpage and as such you'll need a web stack with PHP and MySQL
installed to use this code. 

For local testing I recommend XAMPP but any server stack will work. 

Everything in the root directory can go into the htdocs (or equivalent) of your selected stack. 
To get the data you'll simply need to import the SQL file '341project.sql' in the root directory into you MySQL
install. This will create the database and user with read only privileges required to run the code.

For more complete information on how to install and run the code refer to 'InstallationGuide.pdf' in the 
documentation directory.

Once you have the install complete there is a guide on how to use the interface in 'UsersGuide.pdf' in the
documentation directory.

If you would like to modify the code there is more information in 'ProgrammersGuide.pdf' in the 
documentation directory.
